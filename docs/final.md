### PineVoid (Jacob Gray)
Note: GitHub commit numbers are greatly inflated by my accidental commit and push of the `node_modules` folder, as well as other things (minor changes to large parts of files, commiting of meta-files like package-lock.json, and frequent merges across branches). As of 12/3/22, I estimate my "actual" numbers for substantial commits, additions, and deletions are somewhere around 50-60 for commits (including ~20 very small commits,) around 500-1500 additions, and around 1000 deletions (have no real clue on that.) 
These are all just guesses, but I feel like I've written 250 to 500 lines of code (I'm inclined to guess 500), and I've written much of the documentation (especially for the later parts). I feel like the additions from documentation should total to between 300-1000 substantial additions, with my guess for it being in the 500 range.
