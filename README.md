## Innovative Idea: 
Our idea is to create a website which hosts links and information on artworks of all forms and kinds, from written art to visual art to non-traditional art. This idea is inspired by sites like https://www.goodreads.com/ or https://myanimelist.net/, which serve as databases of artworks of a particular form so that users can find new art, track art they've already seen, or find art of a certain category or type. However, these sites are often oriented towards one particular type of art.

Our application would not only allow different types of art to exist, but would provide a platform for non-traditional types of art to exist which might not otherwise fit nicely into an existing database, such as a segment from a Youtube video or a reddit post. It could also centralize information from different sources (such as from Wikipedia and other database sites,) or provide new sections of information not found on other sites (such as "known references" or "inspirations".)
